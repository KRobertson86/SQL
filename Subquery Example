Here is an example of using a subquery to find the top five countries with the most customers:

SELECT COUNT(A.customer_id) AS all_customer_count, 
D.country,
COUNT(top_five_customers) AS top_customer_count
FROM 
customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id =C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_id = D.country_id
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT A. customer_id,
A. first_name,
A. last_name,
C. city,
D. country,
SUM(E.amount) as total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, city, D.country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora', 'PingXiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 
				'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl',  'Atlixco') 
ORDER BY total_amount_paid DESC
LIMIT 5) AS top_five_customers 
ON A.customer_id = top_five_customers.customer_id
GROUP BY D.country
ORDER BY all_customer_count DESC
LIMIT 5
