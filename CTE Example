Here is an example of using a common table expression to find the average amount paid by the top five customers:

WITH average_amount_paid_cte (customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country)
AS 
(SELECT A. customer_id, A. first_name, A. last_name, C. city, D. country,
SUM(E. amount) AS total_amount_paid
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
INNER JOIN payment E ON A.customer_id = E.customer_id
GROUP BY A.customer_id, city, D.country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora', 'PingXiang', 'Sivas', 'Dhule (Dhulia)', 
				'Kurashiki', 'Xintai', 'Adoni', 'Celaya', 'Nezahualcyotl', 
'Atlixco') )
SELECT customer_id, first_name, last_name, city, country,
AVG(total_amount_paid) AS average_amount_paid
FROM average_amount_paid_cte
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
ORDER BY average_amount_paid DESC
Limit 5
